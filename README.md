# Hi there 👋

I'm a dedicated JavaScript Developer, specializing in TypeScript, React, Vue, and Node.js. I stay updated with the latest development trends to keep my skills sharp.

I actively contribute to open-source projects like [ADAMANT Messenger](https://github.com/adamant-im/adamant-im) and [OpenTrader](https://github.com/bludnic/opentrader). If you are a trader, you may be interested in OpenTrader, an open-source crypto trading bot. Here are the key features:

- **✨ Robust UI:** A user-friendly interface for managing the bots.
- **📊 Builtin Strategies:** Highly configurable trading strategies:
  - **📈 GridBot Strategy:** Buy and sell at predefined intervals to profit from market fluctuations.
  - **📉 RSI Strategy:** Place orders based on the RSI indicator value.
- **🛠️ Custom Strategies:** Create your own strategy in a few lines of code (powered by an auto-generated UI).
- **🌐 Multiple Exchanges:** Trade across various cryptocurrency exchanges.
- **📝 Paper Trading**: Test your strategies without risking real money.
- **⚙️ Easy Installation:** Install effortlessly via NPM for a streamlined setup process.
